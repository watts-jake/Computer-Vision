## cifar10_eda.ipynb
Here I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset. I visualize the dataset and different methods for random erasing data augmentation.

## cifar10_resnet.ipynb
Here I train and test a ResNet with random erasing data augmentation. This was primarily a tutorial to figure out how to implement random data erasing in a TensorFlow framework.

## cifar10_mlp_mixer.ipynb
Here I train and test a MLP-Mixer network as I was interested in learning about image claffication with using a CNN. I also compare the model's perfromance when adding in various types of random erasing.
