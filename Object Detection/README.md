## Detection_Depth_Width.ipynb
Here I explore how changes to the convolutional nueral network's width and depth effect the accuracy of classification and localization on augmented MNIST data.

## RetinaNet_FewShot.ipynb
Here I work with a pre-trained RetinaNet to fine tune the model to detect and classify rubber ducks and evaluate the effect of increasing trainable parameters and adjusting learning rate.
