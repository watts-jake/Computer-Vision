## Model_Attack.ipynb
Here I use the Fast Sign Gradient Method to create adversarial images from the Cifar-10 testing data and evaluate the effect of the attack.

## Attack_LIME.ipynb
Here I use the LIME library to compare visualizations of images and their adversarial counterparts to look for differences.

## Attack_Augmentation.ipynb
Here I add data augmentation in my Xception model training to increase performance and evaluate any changes in attack effectiveness.
